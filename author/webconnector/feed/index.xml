<p>The Nigerian government has extended the deadline for the ongoing national identification number and subscriber identity module (SIM) integration to March 31, 2022.</p>
<p><span class="container container-pod container-pod-short"><span class="adunit-parent hide block-module block-module-ad block-module-ad-300x250"><span class="block-module-image-wrapper"><span class="block-module-image adunit hide" data-adunit="story-300x250-mobile-billboard" data-adsize="300,250" data-adscreenmax="767"></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, a total of 63.97 million lines were disconnected in one year amid the National Identity Number-Subscriber Identity Module data verification.</p>
<p>
<span class="ds-1col file file-image file-image-jpeg view-mode-embedded  centered clearfix block-story-object block-story-object-resource block-story-object-resource-image"><br />
<span class="block-story-object-asset"><img class="media-element file-embedded" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/NIMC-NIN-enrolment-centre.jpeg?itok=_N3OwJQS" alt="" /></span><span class="block-story-object-content"></span><br />
</span>
</p>
<p>This was based on data obtained from the Nigerian Communications Commissions.</p>
<p>The NCC data revealed that the total number of connected lines in the country fell by 21.79 per cent to 229,582,206 in October this year from 293,554,598 in October 2020.</p>
<p>Within the period under review, the number of connected lines was highest in August 2021 (328,114,538) and lowest in September 2021 (229,467,077).</p>
<p>The number of active lines fell from 207,578,237 in October 2020 to 191,618,839 in October 2021, a 7.69 per cent decrease (15,959,398).</p>
<p>According to the commission, 37,963,367 connected lines were inactive as of October 2021, down from 85,976,361 in the same month last year.</p>
<p>Telecommunication companies in the country have been losing subscribers since the Nigerian Government began the linking of NIN with SIM cards.</p>
<p>“Mobile subscribers declined by 7.6 million to 68.9 million, impacted by the regulatory restrictions on new SIM sales and activations,” MTN Nigeria Communications Plc had said in its half-year financial statements.</p>
<p>According to the company, it is actively in support of the government’s NIN enrolment programme.</p>
<p>Airtel, in its quarterly financial statements, had said, “New customer acquisitions were barred until significant progress had been made on linking the active customer base with verified NINs.</p>
<p>“Natural churn in the customer base led to a loss of two million active mobile customers in Nigeria in the first quarter of the year (following on from 2.5 million customer loss in the final quarter of the year to March 31, 2021).”</p>
<p>In December 2020, the Nigerian Government banned the sale and registration of new SIM cards and gave a 30-day deadline for people to link their NIN with their SIM cards. The Nigerian government later extended the exercise to the end of 2021.</p>
<p>When the government banned the sale and registration of SIM cards, the total number of connected lines was 300,042,650, and the total number of active lines was 204,228,678.</p>
<p>According to the government, the SIM-NIN policy is necessary to strengthen security in the country and trace suspects.</p>

<p>Nigeria is set to launch the second satellite (Sat 2) into the orbit to boost the nation’s satellite communications’ capacity.</p>
<p><span class="container container-pod container-pod-short"><span class="adunit-parent hide block-module block-module-ad block-module-ad-300x250"><span class="block-module-image-wrapper"><span class="block-module-image adunit hide" data-adunit="story-300x250-mobile-billboard" data-adsize="300,250" data-adscreenmax="767"></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>The announcement was made by the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof. Isa Pantami, at a one-day working visit and interactions with staff of Nigerian satellite Communications in Abuja.</p>
<p>
<span class="ds-1col file file-image file-image-png view-mode-embedded  centered clearfix block-story-object block-story-object-resource block-story-object-resource-image"><br />
<span class="block-story-object-asset"><img class="media-element file-embedded" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/SATELITE.png?itok=pYDn-g_6" alt="" /></span><span class="block-story-object-content"></span><br />
</span>
</p>
<p>According to Vanguard, the minister hinted that he had secured the approval of President Mohammadu Buhari for purchasing of the satellite.</p>
<p>He noted that he had gone further to lobby the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, to ensure this was included in the 2022 Budget.</p>
<p>The existing Sat1R, which was launched in 2011 with a life span of 15 years, will expire in the next four years.</p>
<p>The federal government had earmarked the sum of N2.5billion for the satellite 2 project in the 2022 budget estimate.</p>
<p>The federal government had in 2017 announced plans to raise $550m required for the construction of two new communications satellites for Nigeria, which the Chinese Export and Import Bank accepted to provide.</p>
<p>Also, the minister said he had approved the establishment of some subsidiaries under NIGCOMSAT, as part of the ongoing effort to revive the institution to the path of progress and productivity.</p>
<p>“Since 2019, I have been so passionate about the success of NIGCOMSAT. Starting with the suspension of the privatisation of NIGCOMSAT. As a matter of fact, I have secured the approval of Mr President for purchasing of another Satellite. I went further to lobby the Minister of Finance to ensure that this is included in the 2022 budget.</p>
<p>“I have also approved establishment of some subsidiaries under NIGCOMSAT as part of efforts to revive the company and make it innovative and productive,” he said.</p>
<p>“It is a difficult task to revive an institution and make it very successful, that you must make. The challenge of reviving NIGCOMSAT is not just a necessity but an obligation for all the staff,” he added.</p>

<p>The Nigerian Communications Commission’s Cyber Security Incident Response Team has warned Nigerians against charging mobile phones using public charging ports or sockets in order to protect them from cyber attacks.</p>
<p><span class="container container-pod container-pod-short"><span class="adunit-parent hide block-module block-module-ad block-module-ad-300x250"><span class="block-module-image-wrapper"><span class="block-module-image adunit hide" data-adunit="story-300x250-mobile-billboard" data-adsize="300,250" data-adscreenmax="767"></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>It also warned against accepting charging cables or chargers from strangers in public places.</p>
<p>
<span class="ds-1col file file-image file-image-jpeg view-mode-embedded  centered clearfix block-story-object block-story-object-resource block-story-object-resource-image"><br />
<span class="block-story-object-asset"><img class="media-element file-embedded" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/page_images/news/2011/%20multiple-smartphones-white-background-story-top.jpg?itok=F3TEOuRd" alt="" /></span><span class="block-story-object-content"></span><br />
</span>
</p>
<p>NCC-CSIRT said the method known as Juice Jacking, is part of two cyber vulnerabilities it identified, the other being Facebook for Android Friend Acceptance Vulnerability, which targets only Android Operating System.</p>
<p>This was disclosed in a statement by Director, Public Affairs, Dr Ikechukwu Adinde.</p>
<p>The statement said Juice Jacking can gain access into consumers’ devices when charging mobile phones at public charging stations and applies to all mobile phones.</p>
<p>The statement reads, “Many public spaces, restaurants, malls and even in the public trains do offer complementary services to their customers in a bid to enhance customer services, one of which is providing charging ports or sockets. However, an attacker can leverage this courtesy to load a payload in the charging station or on the cables they would leave plugged in at the stations.</p>
<p>“Once unsuspecting persons plug their phones at the charging station or the cable left by the attacker, the payload is automatically downloaded on the victims’ phone. This payload then gives the attacker remote access to the mobile phone, allowing them to monitor data transmitted as text, or audio using the microphone.</p>
<p>“The attacker can also watch the victim in real time if the victims’ camera is not covered. The attacker is also given full access to the gallery and also to the phone’s Global Positioning System location.</p>
<p>“When an attacker gains access to a user’s Mobile phone, he gets remote access to the User’s phone which leads to breach in confidentiality, violation of data integrity and bypass of authentication mechanisms. Symptoms of attack may include sudden spike in battery consumption, device operating slower than usual, apps taking a long time to load, and when they load they crash frequently and cause abnormal data usage.</p>
<p>“The NCC-CSIRT, however, proffered solutions to this attack to include using ‘charging only USB cable’, to avoid Universal Serial Bus data connection; using one’s AC charging adaptor in public space; and not granting trust to portable devices prompt for USB data connection.</p>
<p>“Other preventive measures against Juice Jacking include installing Antivirus and updating them to the latest definitions always; keeping mobile devices up to date with the latest patches; using one’s own power bank; keeping mobile phone off when charging in public places; as well as ensuring use of one’s own charger, if one must charge in public.</p>
<p>“The NCC-CSIRT Advisory 0001 also warned that Facebook for Android is vulnerable to a permission issue which gives privilege to anyone with physical access to the android device to accept friend requests without unlocking the phone. The products affected include Versions 329.0.0.29.120 of Android OS.</p>
<p>“With this, the attacker will be able to add the victim as a friend and collect personal information of the victim, such as email, date of birth, check-ins, mobile phone number, address, pictures and other information that the victim may have shared, which would only be visible to his/her friends.</p>
<p>“To be protected from the Facebook-associated vulnerability, NCC-CSIRT in the security advisory recommends to users to disable the feature from their device’s lock screen notification settings.</p>
<p>“The NCC-CSIRT was inaugurated in October, 2021 to provide guidance and direction for the constituents in dealing with issues relating to the security of critical infrastructure in their possession, and periodically assess, review and collate the threat landscape, risks, and opportunities affecting the communications sector, in order to provide advice to relevant stakeholders in those regards.”</p>

<p>Nigeria’s internet users dipped by 7.99 percent to 141.9 million — as telecoms operators lost 12.3 million data subscribers in 2021.</p>
<p><span class="container container-pod container-pod-short"><span class="adunit-parent hide block-module block-module-ad block-module-ad-300x250"><span class="block-module-image-wrapper"><span class="block-module-image adunit hide" data-adunit="story-300x250-mobile-billboard" data-adsize="300,250" data-adscreenmax="767"></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said this in its telecoms data released on Monday.</p>
<p>
<span class="ds-1col file file-image file-image-jpeg view-mode-embedded  centered clearfix block-story-object block-story-object-resource block-story-object-resource-image"><br />

</span>
</p>
<p>Restrictions on sales of SIM cards stifled the telecoms sector in 2021 — coupled with the ongoing National Identification Number and SIM registration exercise.</p>
<p>In 2020, the federal government directed the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to audit the subscriber registration database.</p>
<p>The directive instructed mobile network operators to suspend the sale, registration and activation of new SIM cards.</p>

<div>
<p>Isa Pantami, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, has said the federal government has outlawed the use of generic internet domains for official purposes.</p>
<p><span class="container container-pod container-pod-short"><span class="adunit-parent hide block-module block-module-ad block-module-ad-300x250"><span class="block-module-image-wrapper"><span class="block-module-image adunit hide" data-adunit="story-300x250-mobile-billboard" data-adsize="300,250" data-adscreenmax="767"></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>Pantami said this on Wednesday while addressing newsmen at the end of the weekly federal executive council (FEC) meeting presided over by Vice-President, Yemi Osinbajo.</p>
<p>
<span class="ds-1col file file-image file-image-jpeg view-mode-embedded  centered clearfix block-story-object block-story-object-resource block-story-object-resource-image"><br />
<span class="block-story-object-asset"><img class="media-element file-embedded" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/Isa-Ali-Pantami2.jpeg?itok=5hrogwIw" alt="" /></span><span class="block-story-object-content"></span><br />
</span>
</p>
<p>The minister, controversial for his extremist terrorists preaching, said the council approved the “National Policy on the Government, Second Level Domain”, which mandates the migration of all official communications from generic domains to the nation’s second-level domain under the government top-level domain.</p>
<p>Pantami, whose removal had been demanded by a lot of Nigerians over terrorism-related comments, explained that all government agencies must switch to an official communication medium and stop using public email systems such as Gmail, Yahoo mail, Hotmail, and others.</p>
<p>“This policy has been approved, and it focuses more on mandating federal public institutions, ministries, departments, agencies (MDAs) and all institutions as long as they are for government; they should migrate from using generic domains in their websites and their emails to our second level domain under government top-level domain,” Pantami said.</p>
<p>“For example, you will discover today, some government institutions will engage in official communications using private email: yahoo.com, hotmail.com, gmail.com.</p>
<p>“And it is an official communication and someone may retire or will complete his tenure or the tenure can be terminated, and he will go with the same email. And in that email, there are many official documents.</p>
<p>“So, this will not be tolerated by the government anymore. Any official communications must be using an official email and that email should not be a generic one, it must be ‘.gov.ng.’ What is most important is ‘.ng’ that is our national identity.”</p>
<p>“There are many categories of the second-level domain, some are for military, you will see like mil.ng mil is a short form of military.ng for Nigeria. You can see .gov.ng — Gov for government and ng for Nigeria.</p>
<p>“So, there are categories of the second-level domain, while our country top-level domain.ng must be there in our websites so that whoever gets access will know that this website is from Nigeria, while for email, it must reflect the official name.”</p>

<p>Nigeria’s Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, says Nigerians have the right to be sceptical about the deployment of the 5G Network in the country due to certain beliefs they hold.<br /> <br />Pantami, who is the Chairman of the National Frequency Management Council, said he was one of those who kicked against the use of mobile phones when it was first introduced in the country.</p>
<p><span class="container container-pod container-pod-short"><span class="adunit-parent hide block-module block-module-ad block-module-ad-300x250"><span class="block-module-image-wrapper"><span class="block-module-image adunit hide" data-adunit="story-300x250-mobile-billboard" data-adsize="300,250" data-adscreenmax="767"></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span class="ds-1col file file-image file-image-jpeg view-mode-embedded  centered clearfix block-story-object block-story-object-resource block-story-object-resource-image"><br />
<span class="block-story-object-asset"><img class="media-element file-embedded" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/Isa-Ali-Pantami-Isa-Pantami-Isa-Ali-Ibrahim-Pantami.jpeg?itok=W5hVhHKX" alt="" /></span><span class="block-story-object-content"></span><br />
</span>
</p>
<p>He made the disclosure as a way to allay the negative speculations on the deployment of the 5G network in the country.<br /> <br />Pantami spoke at the public presentation of National Policy on 5G Network and Spectrum for 5G Deployment and the hand-over of the 3.5 gigahertz spectrum to the Nigerian Communications Commission in Abuja.<br /> <br />He said he was against the use of mobile phones because of negative beliefs he held at the time.<br /> <br />However, he attributed some of the theories about 5G in Nigeria to false information circulated by people with no substantial evidence to show for their rejection.<br /> <br />The Minister said, “In 2020 if I could recall vividly in April and May, it was something else. Many citizens were complaining that 5G brought about COVID-19. You know how crazy we are in this country. Anything you drop without looking at the source or authenticity, people will take it.<br /> <br />“I can personally recall that when mobile phones came into Nigeria, some people resisted and there was an allegation that it was linked to cancer and many more.<br /> <br />“I will not feel shy to say that even my humble self, I couldn’t accept the use of mobile phones till after one year. A friend of mine who was working here in Abuja then purchased the mobile phone, and SIM card and sent it to me and said I must use it.<br /> <br />“Maybe he wanted to keep in touch with me so he compelled me to accept mobile phones then. This is to show you that that is our nature. Sometimes we tend to be conservative in doing that.”<br /> <br />On the 5G, he stated that the government suspended the deployment of the technology to address the concerns of Nigerians which was important to the Muhammadu Buhari administration.<br /> <br />He said, “If one person is to be infected by COVID-19 virus, then I should be number one in Nigeria.<br /> <br />“Yesterday I did another Covid test prior to the Federal Executive Council, it was my 52nd test and I’m grateful to almighty Allah that all of them are negative.”<br /> <br />Nigerians have described Pantami, an Islamic cleric, as a closet extremist after the Islamist views he held in the past came to light in 2021.<br /> <br />The Buhari government, however, said it would stand by the minister.<br /> <br />Pantami expressed views sympathetic to groups such as al-Qaeda and Boko Haram.<br /> <br />In a sermon from the 2000s, he said he considered al-Qaeda founder, Osama Bin Laden, a better Muslim than himself. For instance, in a 2006 speech, he publicly offered his condolences after the death of al-Qaeda&#8217;s leader in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.<br /> <br />In another, he said he was happy when infidels were massacred.</p>

<p>The Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government has said that microblogging site, Twitter, is expected to open its Nigerian office before the end of March 2022.</p>
<p><span class="container container-pod container-pod-short"><span class="adunit-parent hide block-module block-module-ad block-module-ad-300x250"><span class="block-module-image-wrapper"><span class="block-module-image adunit hide" data-adunit="story-300x250-mobile-billboard" data-adsize="300,250" data-adscreenmax="767"></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>The Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, made this known when he appeared on a radio progarmme, the Radio Link, in Abuja, noting that the move was part of the agreement the company reached with the Federal Government last year to have the ban imposed on it lifted.</p>
<p>
<span class="ds-1col file file-image file-image-jpeg view-mode-embedded  centered clearfix block-story-object block-story-object-resource block-story-object-resource-image"><br />
<span class="block-story-object-asset"><img class="media-element file-embedded" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/S107672684_preview.jpg?itok=OOG4IRHe" alt="" /></span><span class="block-story-object-content"></span><br />
</span>
</p>
<p>Mohammed asserted that other social media platforms operating in the country would be expected to follow suit, adding that in due course, as the government vowed to ensure that only wholesome content was allowed to pass through the platforms henceforth.</p>
<p>He stressed that the government’s intention to regulate social media was borne out of the desire to sanitise social media and not to stifle the freedom of speech and expression or strangulate the media as some people might believe.</p>
<p>He said, “Twitter also agreed to comply with all payable taxes, as they are operating under Nigerian laws and this they agreed to do within one week of restoring their operations.</p>
<p>”Twitter agreed to immediately work with the Federal Government in the area of code of conduct, that was in line with global best practices</p>
<p>“Twitter agreed to immediately enroll Nigerians in its law enforcement portals and Partners Support Portal.</p>
<p>“The law enforcement portal will provide dedicated channels for the Nigerian law enforcement agencies to escalate reports on contents that violate the code of conduct or national laws.</p>
<p>“Similarly, the partner support portal provides a direct channel for government to engage Twitter staff to manage prohibited contents.</p>
<p>“We are going to regulate the social media not because we want to stifle the media or we want to violate the right of expression. We want to ensure that only wholesome contents are available on social media.</p>
<p>“Recently, we were all shocked when an 18-year old boy, accused of killing his 21-year old girlfriend for money rituals, confessed that he learnt the diabolical act on social media. The teenager, in collaboration with his friends, cut off the head of the victim and was burning it in a pot when they were apprehended.”</p>
<p>“The government has the responsibility to ensure that social media platforms were responsible and the contents they displayed are not harmful to young people, as well as the unity of the country,” he said.</p>
<p>The minister affirmed that relevant laws and the broadcasting code would be amended to ensure that the agreement reached with Twitter was applicable to other social media platforms.</p>

<div>
<p>At least 35million Nigerians do not yet have access to telecommunications and digital financial services.</p>
<p><span class="container container-pod container-pod-short"><span class="adunit-parent hide block-module block-module-ad block-module-ad-300x250"><span class="block-module-image-wrapper"><span class="block-module-image adunit hide" data-adunit="story-300x250-mobile-billboard" data-adsize="300,250" data-adscreenmax="767"></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>This was made known on Tuesday by the executive vice-chairman of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Umar Danbatta, in Abuja during an event to commemorate World Consumer Rights Day 2022, with the theme “Fair Digital Finance.”</p>
<p>
<span class="ds-1col file file-image file-image-jpeg view-mode-embedded  centered clearfix block-story-object block-story-object-resource block-story-object-resource-image"><br />
<span class="block-story-object-asset"><img class="media-element file-embedded" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/Internet-Service-Providers-ISPs-e1555404914471.jpg?itok=QqVgLPn-" alt="" /></span><span class="block-story-object-content"></span><br />
</span>
</p>
<p>The NCC boss emphasised the need for increased investments in fixed and wireless infrastructure to boost financial inclusion.</p>
<p>“As many as 35 million Nigerians are yet to have access to telecommunications services, and by implication, they lack access to digital financial services,” Danbatta said.</p>
<p>“This situation denies these Nigerians access to digital financial inclusion. It is a challenge that is attributable to the inadequacy of both wireless and fibre connectivity infrastructure.</p>
<p>“The fact remains that more citizens will embrace the digital financial culture when they have access to telecom services in the distant, isolated, unserved and underserved communities where they dwell.”</p>
<p>“We are therefore conscious of the urgency of increasing investment in both fixed and wireless infrastructure,” Danbatta said.</p>
<p>“This will make the target of at least 80 percent level of financial inclusion in about four years possible.</p>
<p>“The commission has thus licensed the infrastructure companies (Infracos), which are to provide the fibre from landing ports to the hinterland of the country. A key focus in this regard is to provide broadband connectivity, especially in the 774 local government areas in the country.</p>
<p>“There would be further actions to enable Infracos to commence operations as the commission recognises that fibre is the long-term solution to the volume of transactions in the financial services sector.”</p>
<p>Danbatta who called on stakeholders in the digital finance sector to protect consumers from financial losses, disclosed that the commission would soon establish telecom consumer assistance, resolution and enquiries (TELCARE) desks at strategic locations across the country to provide information to telecom consumers.</p>

<p>Kogi State, the Federal Capital Territory and seven other states in the country may experience a telecom blackout from Tuesday if President Muhammadu Buhari does not prevail on the Kogi State Government to unseal certain telecom infrastructures locked down in the state, telecommunications operators have warned.</p>
<p><span class="container container-pod container-pod-short"><span class="adunit-parent hide block-module block-module-ad block-module-ad-300x250"><span class="block-module-image-wrapper"><span class="block-module-image adunit hide" data-adunit="story-300x250-mobile-billboard" data-adsize="300,250" data-adscreenmax="767"></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>However, the Chairman of the umbrella body of the telcos, Association of Licensed Telecom Operators of Nigeria, ALTON, Gbenga Adebayo, claimed that his members had paid all legitimate taxes and levies in the state, describing the ones in dispute as “unusual.”</p>
<p>According to him, over 70 sites within the state and environs have shut down as a result of wich their members are unable to have access and maintain them.</p>
<p>He called on President Buhari to intervene urgently to avert telecom blackout that may affect Abuja, too.</p>
<p>A statement issued by the body and signed by Adebayo, noted, “The Association of Licensed Telecommunications Operators of Nigeria, ALTON wishes to express concern about the shutting down of telecommunications facilities in Kogi State as a result of disputes arising from unusual taxes and levies demanded by the Kogi State Government through its Internal Revenue Service (KIRS).</p>
<p>“This issue is likely to lead to a total communications blackout in the entire Kogi State, parts of Abuja the Federal Capital Territory.”</p>
<p>It will also “impact on service availability in some parts of the following states: Nassarawa, Benue, Enugu, Anambra, Edo, Ondo, Ekiti, Kwara, Niger States. These are States sharing borders with Kogi State.</p>
<p>“This situation arises as a number of critical telecommunications sites belonging to our members have been closed and sealed up by Kogi State Government in an attempt to increase Internally Generated Revenue IGR collection.</p>
<p>“This action followed an ex-parte court order obtained by the KIRS over unsubstantiated allegations that our members are in default of tax payments to the state government (which is not the truth) and access to these critical telecom sites has been denied.</p>
<p>“As a result of these actions by the state government, our members are unable to refuel power generators in these sites, a situation which has led to outage of over 70 sites including hub sites across parts of Kogi State.</p>
<p>“Now, with likely impact on nine states surrounding Kogi (namely:- Nasarawa, Benue, Enugu, Anambra, Edo, Ondo, Ekiti, Kwara, Niger states. These are states sharing borders with Kogi State; and Abuja the FCT inclusive.</p>
<p>“We are very concerned that this indiscriminate action has the potential of further leading to a total telecommunications outage in Kogi State with neighbouring states and parts of the Federal Capital Territory adversely impacted.</p>
<p>“To the best of our knowledge, our members have settled all statutory levies and taxes due the Kogi State Government and have taken necessary steps to comply with local laws that govern business activities within Kogi State.”</p>
